        <p>
            Welcome to my digital garden. I am a passionate developer who loves exploring the intersection of
            <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>design</strong>.

        <p>
            I believe that code is not just about logic; it's about creating experiences that are intuitive and
            delightful. My journey started with simple scripts and has evolved into building full-stack applications and
            exploring complex systems like Linux/WSL.
