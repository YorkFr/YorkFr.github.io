There is a famous quote that says:

> "If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it."

I've been a consumer of information for a long time. I read technical docs, design blogs, and productivity hacks. But I realized that **consumption is passive**. To truly grow, I needed to switch to **active creation**.

### The Feynman Technique

Richard Feynman, the Nobel prize-winning physicist, had a simple method for learning:

1.  Choose a concept.
2.  Teach it to a child (or write it down simply).
3.  Identify gaps in your understanding.
4.  Review and simplify.

This blog is my attempt at step 2. Whether I'm writing about **Linux configurations**, **Web Design**, or **Life Principles**, the goal is to clarify my own thinking.

### What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

*   **Coding**: Real-world problems I solve (like my recent WSL setup).
*   **Design**: Exploring UI/UX trends.
*   **Growth**: Mental models and productivity systems.

Thanks for joining me on this journey.
