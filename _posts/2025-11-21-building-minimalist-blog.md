I've always believed that a personal website should be a reflection of one's current state of mind. For a long time, I wanted something that felt **clean, professional, and technologically advanced**.

Today, I'm launching the new version of my digital garden, built with **Jekyll** and inspired by **Google's Material Design 3**.

### Why Material Design?

Material Design isn't just about making things look "Google-y". It's about:

1.  **Clarity**: Using whitespace and typography to create hierarchy.
2.  **Interaction**: The subtle lift of a card when you hover over it (`elevation`) gives immediate feedback.
3.  **Adaptability**: It looks great on mobile and desktop.

### The Tech Stack

*   **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll (Simple, fast, secure)
*   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (No heavy frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, just pure CSS variables)
*   **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

### Key Features

I spent a lot of time refining the **Typography**. I'm using a font stack that mimics `Google Sans` to give it that friendly yet professional vibe.

```css
:root {
    --font-sans: 'Google Sans', 'Inter', sans-serif;
    --primary-color: #1a73e8;
    --bg-surface: #ffffff;
}
```

The **Floating Layout** was another fun challenge. Instead of a traditional sidebar, I went for a floating panel design that feels like an app interface.

I hope you enjoy reading here as much as I enjoyed building it.
